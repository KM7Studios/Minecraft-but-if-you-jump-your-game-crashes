# Minecraft but if you jump, your game crashes

Using MCP and 5 minutes of my time, I made it so when you jump, it closes your game.
Install using the JAR installer. The installer loads it into the Minecraft version folder, but you have to create an installation for it.
I do not recommend you do this on any of your favorite worlds, as it may be corrupted.

By the way, the installer won't often update, as if there is a bug with the client, I update that here on GitHub. You only need to open the installer and install it again.

I am not responsible for any damage done.

Go into releases to download the installer.
