# Minecraft but if you jump, your game crashes

Using MCP and 5 minutes of my time, I made it so when you jump, it closes your game.
Install using the JAR installer. The installer loads it into the Minecraft version folder, but you have to create an installation for it.
I do not recommend you do this on any of your favorite worlds, as it may be corrupted.

I am not responsible for any damage done.

Go into releases to download the installer.
